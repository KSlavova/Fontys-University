            <ol>
                <li>
                    Every game starts with a hint that helps you to guess the word.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have two balloons(two tries) at each start.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For each correct letter, you earn a balloon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For each wrong letter, you lose a balloon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game ends when you guess the word or when you lose all your balloons(run out of attempts).

            <h2>Game rules:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>  
                    You can only guess one letter at a time. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a letter repeats itself, you get only one balloon and the letter will automatically appear on its other places.

                    If you guess the word before running out of attempts, you win.
